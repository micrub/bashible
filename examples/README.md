These .ble files are just an example. It works for me but it doesn't mean it will work for you as well unless modified.
At least, you can see how real bashible scripts look like.

When I want to install ruby on my centos, I do:

$ bashible ./ruby.ble

=> it will install some basic software, then RVM and finally the ruby using the RVM
