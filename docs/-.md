#### - COMMAND ARG1 ARG2 ...

Represents a task. The task is a command or a bash function. (Actually, the '-' itself is a bash function and everything that follows are it's arguments.)

When the command exits nonzero, further execution of the script is halted and an error displayed. Sometimes you don't care about the exitcode, in that 
case use [may_fail](may_fail.md).

Finally, the command is not executed if [skip](skip.md) or [skip_if](skip_if.md) have been used previously in the same block of tasks. This is the way
how you can skip tasks that have been already done.

##### Example:

```bash
@ Installing nginx
  - skip_if test -f /usr/bin/nginx
  - yum_install nginx
  - service nginx start

@ Purging temporary files if any
  - may_fail rm /tmp/temp1
  - may_fail rm /tmp/temp2
```
