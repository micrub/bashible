#### - COMMAND [ARG1] [ARG2] ...

Represents a task. The task may be a command or a bash function. (Actually, the '-' itself is a bash function and everything that follows are it's arguments.)

When the command exits nonzero, further execution of the script is halted and an error is displayed. If you don't mind the exitcode,
use [may_fail](may_fail.md) before the command.

Finally, the command is not executed after successful [skip](skip.md) or [skip_if](skip_if.md) in the same block of tasks (this is the way
how to skip tasks that have already been done).

##### Example:

```bash
@ Installing nginx
  - skip_if test -f /usr/bin/nginx
  - yum_install nginx
  - service nginx start

@ Purging temporary files if any
  - may_fail rm /tmp/temp1
  - may_fail rm /tmp/temp2
```
