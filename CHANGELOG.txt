1.0.3 -> 1.0.4
  - tags() doesn't return true if no $TAGS are set; therefore you can use it like this:
    - echo ${TAGS:=all}  # value of $TAGS defaults to "all" unless set
    - skip_if not tags compile install clean all
    - skip_if tags no-download
    etc.
  - internal functions printInfo, printWarn, printError renamed to print_info, print_warn, print_error
  - added var_empty function

1.0.2 -> 1.0.3
  - templating engine (see 'template' function)
  - 'empty' echoes multiline as multiline (bugfix)
  - printing tasks fixed (multiline echoed as multiline)
  - removed unnecessary IFS maniplation
  - fixed import function behaviour (not propagated to called scripts)

1.0.1 -> 1.0.2
  - speed improvements (using bash builtins)
  - fixed bugs in passing arguments to a called script (in force_call)
  - small fixes (2 spaces, better readability)

1.0 -> 1.0.1
  - improved handling of non-existend commands (always fails)
  - new function 'empty', 'nonempty' is deprecated in favour of using 'not empty'
  - delayed_call multiple calls bugfix
  - isolating called scripts (imported functions are not available in a child script)
